Generating Large-Scale Trajectories Efficiently using Double Descriptions of Polynomials

## 0. About
This is a high-performance large-scale trajectory optimizer. It achieves almost the same trajectory quality as the global trajectory optimizer in [Teach-Repeat-Replan](https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/Teach-Repeat-Replan) while using significantly less computation time. The source code will be released.
